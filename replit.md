# Splunk Dashboard Automator

## Overview

The Splunk Dashboard Automator is available in both web and desktop versions. The web application is built with Flask and provides a modern interface with light/dark theme support, while the desktop application uses tkinter for a native GUI experience. Both versions offer secure credential management, automated screenshot capture, dashboard organization, and scheduling capabilities. The desktop version provides direct system access and single-user operation, while the web version supports multi-user access and network deployment.
